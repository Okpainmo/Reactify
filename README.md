## The Reactify blog

The Reactify blog is an amazing project that will host all the technical articles that are being contributed to the Reactify project.

The main technologies used in building the blog/web-app are:

- NextJs(using SSR pre-rendering technique).
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Contentful CMS for Data management.

The [Reactify blog](https://reactify-blog.vercel.app) is already hosted live. But the project is built on [another Github repository](https://github.com/Okpainmo/slik) - the branch name on the previous repository that is currently hosting the blog is the "slik-opensource" branch.

The main task on this branch currently, is to transfer the blog project from the previous repository, to this branch of this repository.

Contributors are welcome to take on that task. Any contributor that's willing to take on that task hould simply do the following.

1. Read the [project announcement article](https://zhacks.hashnode.dev/finish-celebrating-hacktoberfest-2022-by-contributing-to-reactify) - please endeavour to go through the article carefully. This task is a crucial one.

2. Create a new issue regarding this task.

3. Contact a maintainer to assign the task, before proceeding to handle it.
